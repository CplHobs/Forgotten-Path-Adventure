Ideas
List for the team to add any ideas we have for the project. This could also work like a possible
to do list. One of the example projects had this I thought it was a great idea.

- Last meeting it was mentioned we could include the mini game at the end of the path. I think
  this could be plan B if we are not able to implement the mini games along the way or if we 
  run out of time it sounds like it would be easier to implement
